My first full project for The Odin Project foundations course! 

It took around 2 hours to build the basic structure. the first page took the longest, with some copy pasting of the earlier pages to make the second two much faster. Once I finished, I went back and added links to the homepage, just to make it feel complete.

Adding CSS is going to be fun. I can't wait to make this look prettier.
